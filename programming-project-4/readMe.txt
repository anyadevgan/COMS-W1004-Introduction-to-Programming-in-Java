Welcome to my video poker game!
Below is an explanation of the flow of logic used for this game:

On a large scale level, the PokerTest class creates a new game.
Constructor overloading allows two types of games to be created:
a normal game or one that takes in arguments for testing.

The Game class creates a player with a hand of type ArrayList<Card>.
The hand is either randomly generated by the game or supplied by 
the tester.

The hand draws five cards from an instance of the Deck class. The
Deck class is filled with Card types. Each Card object has the 
instance variables suit and rank.

The player is asked if they want to replace any of their five cards
in their hand. The replaceCard() method is called in the play() method
of the Game class to execute this replacement.

Once all the specified cards are replaced, the hand is shown to the player
and evaluated. This evaluation is done using the checkHand() method in the
Game class. This method utilizes a series of if-else if-if statements that
starts with checking the hand for a royal flush (highest payout) and ends 
with checking the hand for no pair (lowest payout).

In the if-else if-else statements mentioned above, the hand was evaluated
by calling smaller submethods in the checkHand() method such as royalFlush()
and straight(). These methods returned a boolean value that indicated if
the hand was that given type or not.

At the end of the game, the player is asked if they would like to play
again. If they have enough money in their bankroll, which is determined by
calling the getBankroll() method in the Player class, then they can play 
again. If not, the game is ended.

Othere descriptions for the logic of the classes and its methods can be
found within the comments of the code.
