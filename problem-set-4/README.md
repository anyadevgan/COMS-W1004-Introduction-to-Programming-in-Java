### PROBLEM SET (40 points)  
*Do the following in Horstmannâ€™s Big Java 7th Edition Chapter 7:*

Review Exercises : R7.5, R7.11, R7.28, R7.30, R7.32

Practice Exercise( 20 points): E7.11 

**Recommended but not for credit:**
 R7.4, R7.7, R7.9, R7.10, R7.18, R7.19,, R7.21, R7.27


 **What to hand in (READ THIS!):**   

For the review exercises submit a single pdf file. Name the file ProblemSet4.pdf. For E7.11 you must fill out the included template in your Problem Set 4 workspace. You do not need to submit a test class (although you should write one to test your work!). We will use a test class simliar to the one included on Codio to check each of your methods. 


### Submitting your work:

For this assignment you should have two files: A single PDF file and a single .java file. The template for E7.10 is already loaded in your workspace on Codio. After you have filled out the template you must export the file from Codio, then together with your pdf for chapter 7 review exercises compress both files into a single zip file, and submit it on Canvas. The compressed file you submit should be called [your UNI]_ps4.zip so for example my submission would be called ac1076\_ps4.zip
